fracstep

fracstep is a CFD simulation programm for direct numerical simulation of two interacting vortices.
It uses a fractional step method as proposed by Kim and Moin (1985). More information can be found
in doc/presentation.pdf.
fracstep is part of an assignment in CFD II course at KIT.

Prerequisites:
- fracstep uses Eigen3 library, which is available at http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

Usage:
0) if necessary, change path to eigen3 library in src/makefile

1) adjust settings in include/settings.hpp

2) compile fracstep by using
	make release	-> speed optimized version
	make debug		-> debug version
   inside src/ directory. 
   You can use make clean to remove object files from src/obj/.
   
3) run bin/fracstep
